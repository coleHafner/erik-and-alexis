				h4 The Mythical State of Jefferson

				p 
					| For West is where we all plan to go some day. It is where you go when the land gives out and the old-field pines encroach. 
					| It is where you go when you get the letter saying: Flee, all is discovered. It is where you go when you look down at the blade 
					| in your hand and the blood on it. It is where you go when you are told that you are a bubble on the tide of empire. 
					| It is where you go when you hear that thar's gold in them-thar hills. It is where you go to grow up with the country. 
					| It is where you go to spend your old age. Or it is just where you go.

				h5 A Destination Wedding

				p 
					| We are as excited for a picture-perfect destination wedding as you are, but before you go, we want to let you know that paradise 
					| may be a little different than you expected: We don’t eat Spam or pay too much for milk. If we stay out late, we don’t get 
					| anxious about our safety if we stray from the resort, and if our sense of adventure comes calling, we prefer a map and compass 
					| over an all inclusive tour package.

				p 
					| This is the 51st State of Jefferson. We like our trees a little more prehistoric, our oceans a little deeper, our mountains 
					| a little more volcanic, and we take our lakes the same way. We like our Shakespeare al fresco, our wine a little smoother, 
					| and our hops a little bolder. We like it here. You might too.


				h5 State of Jefferson FAQs

				ul.faqs
					li
						h6 So, what’s up with the whole “State of Jefferson” thing anyway?

						p 
							| The proposed State of Jefferson is the 51st state in the
							| Union. In 1941, it was originally drawn up as a collection
							| of counties in both southern Oregon (Curry, Jospehine,
							| Jackson, and Klamath Counties) and northern California
							| (Del Norte, Siskiyou, and Modoc Counties). More recently,
							| Jefferson’s borders have expanded northward to include
							| parts of the Umpqua Valley and southward to include
							| the Sacramento Valley.

						li
							h6 Okay, but why?

							p
								| There can be no denying that there is a culture shared by northern California and southern Oregon. Unlike the population
								| centers in central and southern California or northern Oregon, our communities are small and our landscapes are
								| rural. In contrast to the wide river valleys and basins that are characteristic of other parts of Oregon and California, Jefferson
								| is surrounded by the rough terrain of the Coast Range, the Siskiyous, the Cascades, and the Trinity Alps. Unlike
								| the parts of California and Oregon that rely on suits and ties to pay their bills, we work outside, raising living stock, managing
								| timber, harvesting salmon, growing pears, grapes, almonds, rice, and much more.

						li
							h6 There’s a lot of diversity in my state too. So, why is Jefferson any different?

							p
								| As it turns out, the reasons for Jefferson extend beyond cultural identity. In the 1930s, FDR’s New Deal had focused on
								| the development of infrastructure primarily in northern Oregon
								| and central/southern California. After the Depression, this
								| pattern of disproportionate development continued. Increasingly
								| aware of the misrepresentation they were receiving from
								| their state governments, Jeffersonians issued a Proclamation
								| of Independence in November, 1941, and designed a flag
								| featuring a gold pan with 2 X’s, symbolizing that their governments
								| had double crossed them. Although the call for national
								| unity following the attack on Pearl Harbor ended the State of
								| Jefferson movement shortly after it began, the feeling of misrepresentation
								| still remains for many. Since 1941, the counties
								| of northern California and southern Oregon have introduced
								| many State of Jefferson referendums. Although these
								| referendums often pass in some counties, the vote that results
								| in a Jefferson-wide consensus has yet to be reached.

						li
							h6 Is this whole State of Jefferson thing for real?

							p
								| Yes.

						li
							h6 But will it ever actually officially happen?

							p
								| No.

				h4 Crater Lake

				p
					| Crater Lake, high in the Cascade Mountains range, is Oregon’s shimmering blue gem. It is Oregon’s only national park
					| and a must-see landmark during any trip to Southern Oregon.

				p
					| There are two ways many people enjoy the lake. One is to drive the 33-mile Rim Drive and stop at the many vista points
					| overlooking the water. The other is to make the one-mile hike down a switchback trail to the water’s edge, which offers
					| something more special than viewing the lake from the rim but requires a steep and arduous hike.

				p
					| To appreciate Crater Lake, it may help to understand how it came to be. Following the eruption of Mt. Mazama about
					| 7,700 years ago, the mountain collapsed, creating a 2,000-foot deep crater. Over time, this crater was filled with snow
					| melt. The end result is the deepest lake in the United States, which is created without any other freshwater inputs with
					| the exception of snow and characterized by its deep blue color and remarkable water clarity (as deep as 120 feet).
				p
					| The national park becomes a natural play land throughout the year. Snow may linger late into summer, but that doesn’t
					| stop hikers and cyclists from taking advantage.
				p
					| Drive time to Crater Lake from Medford is approximately 1 hr and 30 min.

				h4 Southern Oregon Viticulture

				p
					| The story of Oregon wine no longer begins and ends with
					| Willamette Valley Pinot Noir, as many of the state’s most exciting
					| new offerings hail from Southern Oregon. The region’s six American
					| Viticultural Areas (AVAs) begin at the California border and
					| extend north nearly to Eugene, with many wineries clustered
					| around the Rogue, Applegate, and Umpqua Valleys.
				p
					| Southern Oregon’s latitude and prevailing oceanic winds create
					| a 7 month European-like growing season that distinguishes it
					| from all other west coast (and American) growing regions and
					| this uniquely defines, identifies and unifies us as an ideal place
					| to grow wine grapes.
				p
					| Our wide diurnal temperature swings and mountainous topography;
					| which subdivides the region into a patchwork of mesoclimates
					| ideally suited to growing over 70 different grape varieties
					| is what defines our diversity!
				p
					| Thus, we ripen a dazzling number of grape varieties each at its
					| “Clima tic Edge” with great natural acidity, reasonable alcohol
					| levels and classic varietal aromas and flavors.

			#redwoods
				h4 The Redwoods

				p
					| “Time has a different quality in a forest, a different kind of flow. Time moves in circles, and events are linked, even if it's not
					| obvious that they are linked. Events in a forest occur with precision in the flow of tree time, like the motions of an endless
					| dance.”

				p
					| - Richard Preston, excerpt from The Wild Trees

				p
					| Coast redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) range from southern
					| Oregon to central California, extending not more than fifty
					| miles inland- only as far as the coastal climate has its influence.
					| Fog plays a vital role in the survival of these trees, protecting
					| them from the summer drought conditions typical of
					| this area. They also need abundant winter rain and moderate
					| year round temperatures. In ideal conditions a coast redwood
					| can grow 2-3 feet in height annually, but when the trees are
					| stressed from lack of moisture and sunlight they may grow as
					| little as one inch per year.
				p
					| This species includes the tallest living trees on Earth, reaching
					| up to 379 feet in height and up to 29.2 feet in diameter at
					| breast height (dbh). These trees are also among the oldest
					| living things on Earth, living 1,200 -1,800 years or more.

				p
					| If a trip itinerary includes the Redwoods, we recommend you head to Howland Hill Road in the California part of
					| Jefferson. This unpaved stretch of road offers motorists an intimate encounter with towering old-growth redwoods
					| in Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, and since it's off the beaten path, you won’t have to contend with crowds.
					| Numerous pull-outs and trailheads along the way, including the Boy Scout Tree Trail and Stout Grove, provide the
					| opportunity to enjoy the forest from outside of the car.
				
				p
					| To access Howland Hill Road from Medford, take I-5 north to Grants Pass and continue on U.S. 199 toward Crescent
					| City until the junction with U.S. 101. Head south on U.S. 101 and continue 1 mile south of Crescent City then
					| turn left (east-northeast) onto Elk Valley Road. Drive 1 mile and turn right (east) onto Howland Hill Road; after 1.5
					| miles, Howland Hill Rd. becomes unpaved as it enters Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park. Continue through old
					| -growth redwoods for the next 5.5 miles before Howland Hill becomes Douglas Park Road (paved). After 1.5 miles
					| turn left onto South Fork Road, which rejoins U.S. 199 just east of Hiouchi, California.
				
				p
					| Drive time from Medford to Howland Hill Road is approximately 2.5 hrs.

				p
					| If you plan to camp while you’re at the redwoods, our recommendation is to enjoy dispersed camping at Flint Ridge
					| near Klamath, California. Flint Ridge offers primitive campsites with vault toilets, bear-proof food locker, tables, and
					| fire pits (remember to check fire restrictions prior to camping) with panoramic views of the Pacific Ocean from atop
					| a seaside cliff. Camping at Flint Ridge is free, but requires a backcountry permit, which is available from the following
					| Redwood National and State Parks information centers:

			#caves
				h4 Oregon Caves National Momument

				p
					| Nestled deep in the Illinois River
					| valley in the heart of the Siskiyou
					| Mountains, the Oregon
					| Caves National Monument features
					| caverns formed as rainwater
					| from the ancient forest above
					| dissolved the marble below, creating
					| the "Marble Halls of Oregon."
				p 
					| Exploring the passages of
					| the caves has been a tradition
					| for more than a century. All
					| tours are Ranger-lead and your
					| guide will lead you through the
					| marble corridors and discuss the
					| caves’ natural and cultural history.
					| In addition to exploring the cave,
					| have fun discovering what lies
					| on the surface environment
					| above the cave! There are a variety of adventures to experience aboveground in the Monument’s old-growth forest. This
					| region is recognized as one of the most geologically unique and botanically diverse in the United States, see all there is
					| to see and truly take advantage of your visit!

				p
					| To access Oregon Caves from Medford, take I-5 north
					| to Grants Pass. Take exit 58 to merge onto OR-99 Redwood
					| Highway. Continue for 3 miles and turn right to
					| merge onto US-199 toward Cave Junction (28 miles).
					| Turn left onto OR-46 at the gas station on the corner
					| and follow highway 46 for 20 miles to the Momument.

				p
					| Drive time from Medford to the Momument is approximately 1 hr and 45 min.

				p
					| If your plans include an overnight stay in the Illinois Valley,
					| be sure to check out Out ‘n’ About Treesort, 36
					| acres of pasture and woods on private ownership next
					| to the Siskiyou National Forest, on which visitors can
					| book an overnight stay in the treehouse of their choice! 

			#o-coast
				h4 The Oregon Coast

				p 
					| “Ocean in view! O! The joy!”

				p 
					| - William Clark, from the journal of the Corps of Discovery, Nov. 7, 1805

				p
					| I know a place where time is measured in number of fingers between
					| the setting sun and the horizon. This is the Oregon Coast, and she files
					| on her own wings. While you’re visiting, we recommend that you spend
					| some time on the Coast, and if you forgot your swimsuit, don’t worry,
					| someone will loan you a hoodie. We’re talking to you, Jayhawks.

				p
					| We don’t go to Coast to work on our tans. You won’t see many bikinis
					| on Cape Blanco or folks sitting idly with a book next to the Devil’s
					| Punchbowl. We don’t even call it “the beach.” Although we don’t really
					| do the Jimmy Buffet thing, this is where we live, work, play, hunt, fish,
					| gather, grow, and make art.

				p
					| In Oregon, we don’t come to the Coast seeking the sun, although we
					| do get a glimpses of it from time to time pouring through the canopy of
					| the rainforest to the dense carpet below, but as soon as we hear the
					| surf crashing into the cliffs, we stop paying attention to anything else.
					| That’s the moment we realize how big this all is. Troubles seem smaller
					| and the little moments feel magnified. And as you splash in the tide pools, watch the whales, hunt for agates, explore
					| lighthouses, ride the surf, and wander all 363 miles of coastline, don’t be surprised if you find yourself fighting the urge to
					| rip your return ticket into 363 pieces. And the best part about it all is that, by law, every square inch of Oregon coast is
					| publicly owned. So, go where you please. This coast belongs to all of us!

				p
					| There are lots of places you can go to the beach, but if you want the Coast, you have to come to Oregon.
