			p 
				| For West is where we all plan to go some day. It is where you go when the land gives out and the old-field pines encroach. 
				| It is where you go when you get the letter saying: Flee, all is discovered. It is where you go when you look down at the blade 
				| in your hand and the blood on it. It is where you go when you are told that you are a bubble on the tide of empire. 
				| It is where you go when you hear that thar's gold in them-thar hills. It is where you go to grow up with the country. 
				| It is where you go to spend your old age. Or it is just where you go.

			h5 A Destination Wedding

			p 
				| We are as excited for a picture-perfect destination wedding as you are, but before you go, we want to let you know that paradise 
				| may be a little different than you expected: We don’t eat Spam or pay too much for milk. If we stay out late, we don’t get 
				| anxious about our safety if we stray from the resort, and if our sense of adventure comes calling, we prefer a map and compass 
				| over an all inclusive tour package.

			p 
				| This is the 51st State of Jefferson. We like our trees a little more prehistoric, our oceans a little deeper, our mountains 
				| a little more volcanic, and we take our lakes the same way. We like our Shakespeare al fresco, our wine a little smoother, 
				| and our hops a little bolder. We like it here. You might too.
