		h3 Our story
		p
			| After a sweaty day of field work in summer 2014, Alexis arrived at an “after-hours business meeting for young 
			| professionals” that Hannah, a colleague and mutual friend, had arranged at 7 Devils Brewery in Coos Bay, Oregon. 
			| Unbeknownst to Alexis, Hannah had also invited Erik. Alexis came for professional networking; Erik came for beer 
			| and cigars. What they found was professional networking, beer, cigars, and love. 
		p
			| A month later, Alexis invited  Erik and Hannah to a concert at a local venue. While the musicians that night were 
			| busy making your local middle school band sound like rock gods, Erik was impressing Alexis with his above-average 
			| attention to detail by casually mentioning details from conversation that had taken place at 7 Devils earlier that summer.

		p
			| As the summer turned to fall, Alexis and Erik began hanging out on a regular basis. In October, after a decadent 
			| evening of BBQ, board games, hot tubbing, and uproarious laughter, Erik invited Alexis to join him in harvesting 
			| potatoes and carrots from his garden the next day. This event is significant, because in rural, southwest Oregon, 
			| the harvest of root vegetables constitutes a date. Barely able to contain her excitement, Alexis accepted. 
			| So it was, on an Indian summer day, that Alexis and Erik began their relationship with a day in the garden followed 
			| by a refreshing ginger beer from the same brewery where they had met.

		p
			| Later that week, Alexis and Erik had planned to dig clams with Hannah to accompany with the potatoes and
			| carrots they had harvested a few days earlier. Seeing the opportunity to play the role of match-maker, Hannah
			| canceled last minute, leaving Alexis and Erik alone on the mudflat. This event is significant, because in rural,
			| southwest Oregon, the inter-tidal mudflat is the most romantic venue in which two young lovers can be left
			| alone. Alexis and Erik had a great time, digging their legal limit of 20 clams each, talking, and staying up late
			| cleaning and preparing the meat for chowder. That weekend, the couple cooked their now famous 40-clam
			| clam chowder and shared the meal along with multiple bottles of wine with a group of their friends.

		p 
			| In the weeks following their wild clam chowder party, Alexis fielded phone calls and texts from Erik every day,
			| and by the time the salmon were returning to their natal streams to spawn, they were hopelessly in love. For
			| Halloween that year, Alexis had planned to dress up as a Russian babushka. In an effort to emphasize their
			| relationship status, Erik surprised Alexis with a matching costume. This event is significant because couples
			| costumes are a public proclamation of enduring love and commitment to one another in every corner of the
			| globe. Impressed by Erik’s above-average courtship etiquette, Alexis was forever his from that day on.

		p
			| Alexis and Erik began their relationship on a solid foundation of friendship, adventures, and shared interests.
			| They learned to love and appreciate each other by trying their best to make use of what could be grown and
			| harvested around them, a lifestyle that remains extremely important to them. Looking toward the future, they
			| are excited to begin their life together as husband and wife, surrounded by friends and family and continuing to
			| farm, fish, hunt, and gather their way through life together with their beloved orange cat boys, Finley and Cheddar.
