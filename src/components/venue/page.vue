			h3 Hanely Farm
			
			p
				| Hanley Farm is a historic farmstead on Jackson Creek about two miles northeast of Jacksonville, 
				| Oregon. For more than a century, the Farm was owned and operated entirely by Hanley women, most 
				| notably Alice Hanley and her nieces Claire, Martha, and Mary, who played prominent roles in Jackson 
				| County horticulture and in the preservation of southern Oregon history, particularly in the 
				| establishment and operation of the Southern Oregon Historical Society.

			p
				| The Farm was established in 1852, when the Welton family entered into a joint venture with
				| the neighboring Clinton family to establish land claims totaling 636 acres in the Rogue Valley.
				| Shortly after its establishment, the claim was sold to Michael (7824-1889) and Martha Hanley
				| (1832-1887), who had joined the California Gold Rush in the 1850s, but soon diverged into
				| livestock dealing in southern Oregon. For the next few decades, Michael and Martha continued 
				| making land acquisitions and raised horses, mules, cattle, sheep, and alfalfa on more than 2,000 
				| acres in Jackson County.

			p 
				| Following Martha’s death, Michael’s health deteriorated. Unable to tend to the family holdings, 
				| Michael bequeathed the Farm to Alice Hanley (1859-1940). In the following decades, Alice’s 
				| burgeoning interest in agriculture led to other valuable community contributions. In 1919, Alice
				| founded the state Home Extension Service (now the Oregon State University Extension Service), 
				| which seeks to improve the livelihoodof local farmers by providing educational consultations 
				| and pairing scientists with landowners to address high-priority agricultural research questions.

			p
				| Throughout the 20th century, the Hanley sisters continued making valuable community contributions.
				| Claire Hanley (1898-1963) was one of the founders of the Southern Oregon Historical Society and
				| was its president from 1949 until her death. Mary Hanley (1893-1986) donated 80 acres to the 
				| County at the site of present-day site of the Claire Hanley Arboreteum, which was first planted 
				| in 1960. She also served as the curator of the Jacksonville Museum from 1955 to 1969. In 1982, 
				| Mary Hanley donated an additional 37 acres to Jackson County at the site of the original family 
				| farmstead. One year later, Hanley Farm was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. 
				| The Hanley Farm has a main residence, two large barns, a stone springhouse, and a number of 
				| outbuildings. Most of the original land grant is still in agricultural production.

			p
				| Today, produce from Hanley Farm supplies a CSA (community supported agriculture) operation, 
				| roadside farm stand, and the Jacksonville Farmers Market. The Farm offers a variety of agriculture
				| and history-related and educational programs throughout the year. The focus of these programs 
				| is to promote historical farming methods that are ecologically sound, including husbandry of 
				| heritage livestock and no-till, chemical-free vegetable cultivation. The Hanley Farm is a rare 
				| example of a historical agricultural landscape in Oregon and a testament to the significance 
				| of the Hanley women as farmers, gardeners, and historic preservationists.
